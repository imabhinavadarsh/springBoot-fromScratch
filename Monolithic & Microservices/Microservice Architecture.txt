What is Microservices Architecture?
Microservices architecture is an approach to building software where you break down your application into smaller, 
independent services. Each service handles a specific task, like user authentication or processing orders, and they communicate 
with each other over the network.

Why Microservices?
Think of it like having a toolbox with different tools for different jobs. In a monolithic architecture, it's like having one giant tool 
that does everything. But with microservices, each tool is separate, so if you need to change or fix one tool, you don't have to mess 
with the others. It's easier to manage and scale your application this way.

Example: 
Let's say you're building an online store. Instead of building the entire store as one big piece of software, you break it down into smaller services:

User Service: This service handles user authentication and management. It allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
Product Service: This service manages all the products in the store. It handles tasks like adding new products, updating product information, and managing inventory.
Order Service: This service handles the order processing. When a user makes a purchase, this service handles creating the order, calculating the total, and updating the inventory.
Payment Service: This service handles payment processing. It communicates with payment gateways to process transactions securely.
Each of these services is independent and communicates with the others through well-defined APIs. So, if you need to update the payment process or add a new feature to user 
management, you can do it without affecting the other parts of the system. That's the flexibility and modularity of microservices architecture.
